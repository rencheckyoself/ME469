# Running Instructions:

1. Place all python scripts in the same directory as the dataset.

2. Run one of the run_me files making sure the terminal is set to the directory containing the script and data.
  - `run_me_ds1.py` is configured to run LWLR on `learning_dataset.csv`.
  - `run_me_ds2.py` is configured to run LWLR on `learning_dataset_vish.csv`.

  - Run Time is ~10min for each file.

# Other Files

- `machine_learning.py` contains the code for the LWLR algorithm.

- `data_creation.py` will generate the `learning_dataset.csv` file.

- `learning_dataset_vish.csv` was provided by my partner.

- `LWLR_dataset1.pdf` is a technical report for how `learning_dataset.csv` was formulated and created as well as how the LWLR algorithm was implemented and a summary of the results.

- `LWLRComparison.pdf` is a technical report comparing the two datasets as well as LWLR and a Neural Network applied to the `learning_dataset_vish.csv`.

- The orignal data is encompassed by the .dat files.
